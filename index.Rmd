# This is Christie's awesome website

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/drXGoW1iudhKw/giphy.gif)

I can link to useful things like [google](https://www.google.com/) and [p8105](https://www.p8105.com/)

Specify the full web address (copy and paste from website)

I can make an extra page on my site and link to that. Here's my [about](about.html).

This is an about HTML file that's in the same repo. 

## Here's Murphy 

My brother's dog's name is Murphy. He's a good friend. Here he is:

Example two with scaling: 

Sometimes Murph-a-durph is in pain, because he's had a procedure done:

## Created a new text file 

_site.yml - describes overall attributes of your website that's applied to every page of that site. 

This is what puts in the navigation bar 
Have to re-knit all pages to get navigation bar on all pages 

Font Awesome - this is where you can get icons for additional navigation bars. 

Can also skip a lot of this with the website template 

## Now R knows we're building a website

When we first opened things, R didn't know we were making a website. Now, R sees that we're doing that, so we quit and reopen R. Then look at Build tab - this picks up on the fact that we're building a website, so we can build it without re-knitting everything because now R knows to apply to all the individual pages. 

## Making sure other people can access your website

Go to cmzettler.github.io and this will be public 

Github tries to understand it's very best what you're doing 

Can change themes with bootstrap 

If you like something about a a website that looks like it's an R/ github website, go play around on github until you find the pieces that you're interested in and you can get it.
